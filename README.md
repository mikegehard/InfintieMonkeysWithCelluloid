The original implementation of this problem can be found [here](http://letitcrash.com/post/17888436664/a-sample-application-showcasing-play-mini-and-akka).

I decided to try out the same problem in Ruby using the [Celluloid library](https://github.com/tarcieri/celluloid).

This repo is the result of my labors. Feedback and pull requests welcome.
